      <em>The Lada </em> / <strong>VAZ-2105</strong> , 2104 and 2107,
      collectively marketed as Lada Riva for right-hand drive models (in the
      United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand), the Lada Nova in Germany, and
      by multiple other names and markets,[2] are a series of compact sedans of
      the Zhiguli line-up (Fiat 124-based cars), built by Russian car
      manufacturer AvtoVAZ (formerly VAZ). Introduced in 1979 in the Soviet
      Union, and progressively introduced to Western European and global markets
      from the early 1980s, under the Lada brand, they were sold as saloons
      (2105 and 2107), and station wagon (2104) versions. Today they are
      generally referred to as the Lada Classic series,[7] being derived from
      the original Fiat 124 platform which has been the now-iconic mainstay of
      the AvtoVAZ lineup since the company's foundation in the late 1960s.
      Russian production at the company's main plant at Togliatti ended in
      September 2012. Along with the other Fiat 124 derivatives, it is the
      world's third best selling, single generation automobile platform, after
      the Volkswagen Beetle and the Ford Model T,[18][19] and one of the longest
      production run platforms alongside the Volkswagen Beetle, the
